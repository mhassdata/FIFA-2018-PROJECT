## RESULTS

After analysing Fifa data set and we can see that Spain rates high in multiple factors on these analysis and based on that we can state that Spain is a very competitive league and does have some of the best players in the world.

And two of those players stand above the rest and those players are Christiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi.

When it comes to who is the best player in the world this topic can get heated as both players stand out with such amazing skills and attributes.

To answer this question it would come down to preference as their numbers are both outstanding and for me I love the south American style of game and would say Messi is the best player on the world I would recommend taking a closer look at the data and making your decision.
